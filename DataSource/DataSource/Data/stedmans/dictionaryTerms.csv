100310|Y-linkage|link′ij|The state of a genetic factor (gene)'s being borne on the Y chromosome. This idea is analogous with X-linkage, but given that the Y chromosome does not fully take part in chiasma formation and recombination, it is not amenable to analysis by conventional linkage methods. Little is known about its content. There is a gene for the H-Y antigen, and indirect arguments suggest that there is a principle that determines the formation of the testis and masculinization of the fetus but its localization, although narrowing the limits, remains elusive.
