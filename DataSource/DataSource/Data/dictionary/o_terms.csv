62019|obese|ō-bēs′|Excessively fat.
62020|obesity|ō-bē′si-tē|An excess of subcutaneous fat in proportion to lean body mass. Excess fat accumulation is associated with increase in the size (hypertrophy) as well as the number (hyperplasia) of adipose tissue cells. Obesity is variously defined in terms of absolute weight, weight:height ratio, distribution of subcutaneous fat, and societal and esthetic norms. Measures of weight in proportion to height include relative weight (RW, body weight divided by median desirable weight for a person of the same height and medium frame according to actuarial tables), body mass index (BMI, kg/m²) and ponderal index (kg/m³). These do not differentiate between excess adiposity and increased lean body mass. In contrast, subscapular and triceps skinfold measurements and determination of the waist:hip ratio help define the regional deposition of fat and differentiate the more medically significant central obesity from peripheral obesity in adults. No single cause can explain all cases of obesity. Ultimately it results from an imbalance between energy intake and energy expenditure. Although faulty eating habits related to failure of normal satiety feedback mechanisms may be responsible for some cases, many obese people neither consume more calories nor eat different proportions of foodstuffs than nonobese persons. Contrary to popular belief, obesity is not caused by disorders of pituitary, thyroid, or adrenal gland metabolism. However, it is often associated with hyperinsulinism and relative insulin resistance. Studies of obese twins strongly suggest the presence of genetic influences on resting metabolic rate, feeding behavior, changes in energy expenditures in response to overfeeding, lipoprotein lipase activity, and basal rate of lipolysis. Environmental factors associated with obesity include socioeconomic status, race, region of residence, season, urban living, and being part of a smaller family. The prevalence of obesity is greater when weight is measured during winter rather than summer. Obesity is much more common in the southeastern U.S., although the northeastern and midwestern states also have high rates, a phenomenon independent of race, population density, and season.

There are several forms of autosomal recessive inheritance: type IA is characterized by absence of tyrosinase with life-long complete absence of melanin, marked photophobia, and nystagmus, caused by mutation in the tyrosinase gene (TYR) on chromosome 11q. Type II has normal tyrosinase activity and is the most common; hair color darkens and nevi and freckles develop; caused by mutation in the oculocutaneous abinism gene (OCA2) on 15q. Type III is characterized by absent tyrosinase but pigmentation of the iris in the first decade; caused by mutation in the tyrosine-related protein-1gene (TYRP1) on 9p. Type IV is found in Africans with normal tyrosinase and type V is associated with red hair. Type VI is synonymous to Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome [MIM*203300], with low to absent tyrosinase and hemorrhage due to platelet deficiency, caused by mutation in the Hermansky-Pudlak gene (HPS) on 10q.

62391|ointment|oynt′ment|A semisolid preparation usually containing medicinal substances and intended for external application. Ointment bases used as vehicles fall into four general classes: 1) hydrocarbon bases (oleaginous ointment bases) keep medicaments in prolonged contact with the skin, act as occlusive dressings, and are used chiefly for emollient effects; 2) absorption bases either permit the incorporation of aqueous solutions with the formation of a water-in-oil emulsion or are water-in-oil emulsions that permit the incorporation of additional quantities of aqueous solutions; such bases permit better absorption of some medicaments and are useful as emollients; 3) water-removable bases (creams) are oil-in-water emulsions containing petrolatum, anhydrous lanolin, or waxes; they may be washed from the skin with water and are thus more acceptable for cosmetic reasons; they favor absorption of serous discharges in dermatologic conditions; and 4) water-soluble bases (greaseless ointment bases) contain only water-soluble substances.
9595|ointment base||the vehicle into which active ingredients may be incorporated. Petrolatum (which may be stiffened with wax) is the most widely used greasy ointment base and is suitable for the incorporation of oleaginous materials. Lanolin-containing bases will absorb water (and dissolved materials) and form water-in-oil type emulsions. Water soluble (washable) bases are often derived from polymers of ethylene glycol (PEGS); these will absorb water and ingredients dissolved in the water. Ointment bases are usually pharmacologically inert but may entrap water and serve to keep the skin from dying or to provide an emollient protective film.

53334|ordered mechanism||a scheme for substrate binding and product release for multisubstrate enzymes; for a two-substrate two-product enzyme with an ordered mechanism, one particular substrate has to first bind to the enzyme, followed by the other substrate; chemistry then occurs, and products are formed and are released from the enzyme in a distinct order. More complex ordered schemes exist for enzymes having more than two substrates. Some dehydrogenases have such a mechanism.
53335|ordered on–random off mechanism||a scheme for substrate binding and product release for multisubstrate enzymes; for a two-substrate two-product enzyme with this mechanism, the reactants must bind to the enzyme in a distinct order; however, after the products have been formed, they may dissociate from the enzyme in either order.
