By passing through a mirrored tube, the photons are released as a nondivergent (""collimated""), monochromatic (all one wavelength), coherent (all in phase) beam.  Lasers are used in microsurgery, for cauterization, excision, and for a variety of diagnostic purposes. The wavelength delivered depends on the active medium excited; targetted tissues (""chromophores"") are determined by the laser wavelength that they absorb. Laser dosage, or fluence, delivered is derived by dividing the energy delivered by the cross-sectional area of the beam (Joules/CM²). Lasers can be based on numerous chemical sources, gas, liquid, and solid, some of which are listed in the chart on p. 105&#&Lasers are widely used in printers of text or x-ray images.&#&(verb) To treat a structure with a laser beam."

11001|Leishman-Donovan body|līsh′măn don′ŏ-văn|the intracytoplasmic, nonflagellated leishmanial form of certain intracellular parasites, such as species of Leishmania or the intracellular form of Trypanosoma cruzi; originally used for Leishmania donovani parasites in infected spleen or liver cells in kala azar.
48666|Leishmania|lēsh-man′ē-ă|A genus of digenetic, asexual, protozoan flagellates (family Trypanosomatidae) that occur as amastigotes in the macrophages of vertebrate hosts, and as promastigotes in invertebrate hosts and in cultures. Species are largely indistinguishable morphologically but may be distinguished by clinical manifestations, geographic distribution and epidemiology, developmental patterns of promastigotes in their sandfly hosts, virulence testing of clones in vivo, the effect of test sera on growth in culture, cross-immunity tests, and serotyping with promastigote excreted factors; strains also can be distinguished by various biochemical analyses and DNA sequencing. Such procedures have identified all recognized groups and confirmed the separation of New World leishmaniasis agents into two species complexes, Leishmania mexicana and Leishmania braziliensis.
48667|Leishmania aethiopica||an African species of Leishmania responsible for human cutaneous leishmaniasis in Ethiopia, with a reservoir of human infection in the rock hyraxes, Procavia capensis and Heterohyrax brucei, and in Kenya, with reservoirs in the tree hyrax, Dendrohyrax arboreus, and the giant rat, Cricetomys gambianus; vectors are the sandflies Phlebotomus longipes and P. pedifer. It causes a cutaneous leishmaniasis of three types: classical oriental sore, mucocutaneous leishmaniasis, and diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis; ulceration is late or absent and healing takes one to three years.
48668|Leishmania braziliensis||a species that is the causal agent of mucocutaneous leishmaniasis, endemic in southern Mexico and Central and South America, and transmitted by various species of Lutzomyia (New World sandflies); forest rodents and other tropic arboreal animals serve as reservoir hosts. Leishmania braziliensis is currently divided into three clinically, epidemiologically, and biochemically distinct strains or subspecies: Leishmania b. braziliensis, Leishmania b. guyanensis, and Leishmania b. panamensis.
48669|Leishmania braziliensis braziliensis||the type subspecies of Leishmania braziliensis and the agent of mucocutaneous leishmaniasis. A natural reservoir of infection remains unknown, but the proven vector in Brazil is Lutzomyia (Psychodopygus) wellcomei; other sandflies may also transmit the infection.
48670|Leishmania braziliensis guyanensis||a subspecies within the Leishmania braziliensis complex from Brazil and Guyana, and the cause of the cutaneous leishmaniasis condition locally known as “pian bois”; the reservoir host in Brazil is the sloth Choloepus hoffmani and the vector is the sandfly Lutzomyia umbratilis.
48671|Leishmania braziliensis panamensis||a subspecies of Leishmania braziliensis found in Panama, Colombia, and neighboring regions; it causes ulcerating lesions of cutaneous leishmaniasis that do not heal spontaneously and often involve nearby lymphatic tissues, but nasopharyngeal involvement is rare. The sloth Choloepus hoffmani is the reservoir in Panama and Costa Rica; the sandfly Lutzomyia trapidoi has been proven to be a vector.
48672|Leishmania donovani||a species that is the causal agent of visceral leishmaniasis in Mediterranean and adjacent countries, the south central section of western Asia, eastern India, northern China, Kenya, Ethiopia, and the Sudan; also found in Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, and Venezuela; in the Old World, it is transmitted by various species of Phlebotomus; New World vectors are species of Lutzomyia; dogs and other carnivores are known as reservoir hosts in some areas. The intracellular amastigote form multiplies in macrophages and produces a reticuloendothelial hyperplasia grossly affecting the spleen and liver, with other lymphoid tissues being involved as well, resulting in severe hepatosplenomegaly, which usually is fatal if untreated.
48673|Leishmania donovani archibaldi||
48674|Leishmania donovani chagasi||a subspecies of Leishmania found in South America, chiefly in Brazil, producing visceral leishmaniasis; infections have been found in domestic dogs and in foxes, although the primary reservoir host is unclear. The vector remains undiscovered, and the taxonomic status of this subspecies is uncertain.
48675|Leishmania donovani donovani||the type subspecies and agent of visceral leishmaniasis in Asia, Africa, and the Indian subcontinent; a few cases occur in the south central section of western Asia, and in Iran, Iraq, and possibly Yemen; the dog and jackal are animal reservoirs. The form in Africa may be this subspecies, though the name Leishmania donovani archibaldi is also used.
48676|Leishmania donovani infantum||a strain or subspecies of Leishmania donovani that causes visceral leishmaniasis in young children in Mediterranean countries; the reservoir is the domestic dog.
48677|Leishmania furunculosa||former name for Leishmania tropica.
48678|Leishmania major||a species responsible for zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis in a large area of the Mediterranean region and Asia Minor. The animal reservoirs are usually ground squirrels, such as Rhombomys opimus in parts of Russia and elsewhere in south central Asia, and other rodents in northwest India, the Middle East, and northern Africa; proven sandfly vectors include Phlebotomus papatasi, P. duboscqi, and P. salehi.
48679|Leishmania mexicana||the agent of many forms of cutaneous leishmaniasis, now considered a complex of several subspecies or possibly species, each with distinctive DNA and enzyme characteristics, distribution, and vector-reservoir host association, resulting in distinct manifestations of human leishmaniasis; reservoir hosts are extremely diverse and include a wide array of arboreal rodents as well as marsupials, primates, and small carnivores. Typical disease forms caused by this species are chiclero ulcer and diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis, in contrast with mucocutaneous leishmaniasis, more characteristic of Leishmania braziliensis infection.
48680|Leishmania mexicana amazonensis||a particularly widespread form of Leishmania mexicana in the Amazon basin (Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, and southern Venezuela), where it infects a variety of forest rodents, the reservoirs of human infection. The disease is rare in humans, but the single or multiple lesions, when induced, rarely heal spontaneously; the disseminated form is common, but nasopharyngeal involvement does not occur. The vector is the sandfly Lutzomyia flaviscutellata.
48681|Leishmania mexicana garnhami||a subspecies of Leishmania mexicana, found in western Venezuela, causing single or multiple lesions in humans that heal spontaneously in about 6 months; the probable sandfly vector is Lutzomyia townsendi.
48682|Leishmania mexicana mexicana||a species described from Mexico, Guatemala, and Belize; agent of a form of New World cutaneous leishmaniasis called chiclero ulcer, associated with chicle gum and mahogany forest workers. The New World sandfly, Lutzomyia olmeca, is a proven vector of this subspecies.
48683|Leishmania mexicana pifanoi||a strain of Leishmania mexicana accorded species status by those who consider it responsible for the diffuse or disseminated form of cutaneous leishmaniasis. It is responsible for this condition in Venezuela, where it was described, but it is now recognized that several species and subspecies of Leishmania cause similar disseminated forms of leishmaniasis in widely separated regions (Leishmania mexicana amazonensis, Leishmania aethiopica); absence or suppression of the cell-mediated immune response in the host is also an important factor in induction of diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis.
48684|Leishmania mexicana venezuelensis||a more recently described subspecies of Leishmania mexicana from Venezuela that causes indolent, nodular, single lesions of cutaneous leishmaniasis to develop, sometimes with curable disseminated cutaneous leishmaniasis; infection has also been found in equines.
48685|Leishmania peruviana||species of Leishmania found infecting humans in the high Andean valleys of Peru and Bolivia; cause of a distinct form of New World cutaneous leishmaniasis called uta.
48686|Leishmania pifanoi||
48687|Leishmania tropica||species that is the causal agent of anthroponotic cutaneous leishmaniasis; formerly endemic throughout the Mediterranean basin, the Middle East, parts of the Caucasus region and elsewhere in Asia, and also reported from western Africa; it is transmitted by Phlebotomus papatasi, P. sergenti, and related species of sandflies; small rodents such as various ground squirrels serve as reservoir hosts.

Each is clinically and geographically distinct and each has been newly subdivided into clinical and epidemiologic categories. Transmission is by various sandfly species of the genus Phlebotomus or Lutzomyia.
48709|leishmaniasis recidivans||a partially healing leishmanial lesion caused by Leishmania tropica and characterized by an extreme form of cellular immune response, intense granuloma production, fibrinoid necrosis without caseation, and frequent development of satellite lesions that continue the production of granulomatous tissue and scarring without healing, sometimes over a period of many years; organisms are difficult to demonstrate but can be cultured.

Under various abnormal conditions the total numbers or proportions, or both, may be characteristically increased, decreased, or unaltered, and leukocytes may be present in other tissues and organs. Leukocytes represent three lines of development from primitive elements: myeloid, lymphoid, and monocytic series. On the basis of features observed with various methods of staining with polychromatic dyes (Wright stain) cells of the myeloid series are frequently termed granular leukocytes, or granulocytes; cells of the lymphoid and monocytic series also have granules in the cytoplasm, but owing to their tiny size and varied properties (frequently not clearly visualized with routine methods), lymphocytes and monocytes are sometimes termed nongranular or agranular leukocytes. Granulocytes are commonly known as polymorphonuclear leukocytes (also polynuclear or multinuclear leukocytes), inasmuch as the mature nucleus is divided into two to five rounded or ovoid lobes that are connected with thin strands or small bands of chromatin; they consist of three distinct types: neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils, named on the basis of the staining reactions of the cytoplasmic granules. Cells of the lymphocytic series occur as three types, based on the identity of their surface receptors: B lymphocytes, T lymphocytes, and null cells. Morphologically, there are two, somewhat arbitrarily designated, normal varieties: small and large lymphocytes; the former represent the ordinary forms and are conspicuously more numerous in the circulating blood and normal lymphoid tissue; the latter may be found in normal circulating blood but are more easily observed in lymphoid tissue. The small lymphocytes have nuclei that are deeply or densely stained (the chromatin is coarse and bulky) and almost fill the cells, with only a slight rim of cytoplasm around the nuclei; the large lymphocytes have nuclei that are approximately the same size as, or only slightly larger than, those of the small forms, but there is a broader, easily visualized band of cytoplasm around the nuclei. Cells of the monocytic series are usually larger than the other leukocytes, and are characterized by a relatively abundant, slightly opaque, pale blue or blue-gray cytoplasm that contains myriad extremely fine reddish-blue granules. Monocyte nuclei are usually indented, reniform, or horseshoe shaped, but are sometimes rounded or ovoid; their nuclei are usually large and centrally placed and, even when eccentrically located, are completely surrounded by at least a small band of cytoplasm.

Nymphs and larvae feed especially on the white-footed mouse, Peromyscus leucopus, while the preferred host of adults is the white-tailed deer, Odocoileus virginianus. Infected reservoir animals and ticks do not become ill. Residual articular or neurologic symptoms, which may persist for months or years after the initial infection, presumably reflect an immune response to the organism. Variations in clinical features or severity from one patient to another may be due to inborn variations in immune response, perhaps linked to the human lymphocytic antigen (HLA) system.
