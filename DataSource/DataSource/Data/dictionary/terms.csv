5774|absolute risk approach||a disease-control method based on the observation that proportional reduction in risk for given absolute reductions in risk factors is independent of the level of the risk factor: for instance reducing systolic blood pressure by 10 mmHg produces the same percentage reduction in risk of heart attack or stroke at all levels of pretreatment blood pressure. The benefits of reducing such risk factors depend mainly on the absolute risk of disease, not on the pretreatment levels of specific risk factors. This contrasts with risk factor management based on a threshold for each factor (blood pressure, cholesterol level) above which a treatable abnormality (hypertension, hyperlipidemia) is deemed to be present. Absolute risks are strongly influenced by unmodifiable risk factors such as age, sex, and prior history of disease and are expressed as percentage probabilities of disease occurrence within specified time horizons, usually 5 or 10 years. Under the absolute risk approach, the decision to treat elevated blood pressure or serum cholesterol depends on the estimated overall level of risk rather than the level of any single risk factor. Implementing an absolute risk approach may imply substantial changes to public health strategies and to the circumstances in which allocation of resources for preventive medication is justifiable.

HIV is transmitted from person to person in cell-rich body fluids (notably blood and semen) through sexual contact, sharing of contaminated needles (as by IV drug abusers), or other contact with infected blood (as in accidental needlesticks among health care workers). Maternal-fetal transmission also occurs. The primary targets of HIV are cells with the CD4 surface protein, including principally helper T lymphocytes. Antibody to HIV, which appears in the serum 6 weeks to 6 months after infection, serves as a reliable diagnostic marker but does not bind or inactivate HIV. Gradual decline in the CD4 lymphocyte count, typically occurring over a period of 10–12 years, culminates in loss of ability to resist opportunistic infections. The appearance of one or more of these infections defines the onset of AIDS. In some patients, generalized lymphadenopathy, fever, weight loss, dementia, or chronic diarrhea occurs much earlier in the course of the infection. Untreated AIDS is uniformly lethal within 2–5 years after the first appearance of an opportunistic infection. Besides prophylaxis against opportunistic infection, standard therapy of HIV infection includes use of nucleoside analogues (didanosine, lamivudine, ribavirin, stavudine, zipovudine), nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (delavirine, efavirenz, nevirapine) and protease inhibitors (atazanavir, crixivan, indinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir).

The lower third of the aponeurosis does not split but joins the aponeuroses of the external abdominal oblique and transversus abdominis muscles to form the anterior wall of the sheath of the rectus abdominis muscle. The fibers of the portion of the aponeurosis contributing to the rectus sheath decussate with those of the contralateral aponeurosis in the linea alba. The lowermost portion of the aponeurosis blends with the aponeurosis of the transversus abdominis muscle to form the conjoint tendon, attaching to the pubic crest and often the pecten pubis, thus forming the posterior wall of the inguinal canal at the superficial inguinal ring.

5888|arachnoid mater||a delicate fibrous membrane forming the middle of the three coverings of the central nervous system. In life, the arachnoid (specifically the arachnoid barrier cell layer) is tenuously attached to the externally adjacent dura mater (specifically the dural border cell layer), and no natural space occurs at the dura-arachnoid interface. Thus, in a spinal puncture, dura mater and arachnoid are penetrated simultaneously as if a single layer. Separation of the arachnoid mater from the dura mater (usually through the dural-border cell layer) may result from traumatic or pathologic processes creating what is commonly, but incorrectly, called a subdural hematoma. The arachnoid mater is named for the delicate, spiderweblike filaments that extend from its deep surface, through the cerebrospinal fluid of the subarachnoid space, to the pia mater.

These taxonomically diverse animal viruses are unified by an epidemiologic concept, transmission between vertebrate hosts by blood-feeding (hematophagous) arthropod vectors (mosquitoes, ticks, sandflies, and midges). Although about 100 species can infect humans, in most instances diseases produced by these viruses are of a mild nature and difficult to distinguish from illnesses caused by viruses of other taxonomic groups. Apparent infections may be separated into several clinical syndromes: undifferentiated-type fevers (systemic febrile disease), hepatitis, hemorrhagic fevers, and encephalitides.

26306|autonomic (visceral motor) division of nervous system||that part of the nervous system that represents the motor innervation of smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, and gland cells. It consists of two physiologically and anatomically distinct, mutually antagonistic components: the sympathetic and parasympathetic parts. In both these parts, the pathway of innervation consists of a synaptic sequence of two motor neurons, one of which lies in the spinal cord or brainstem as the presynaptic (also called preganglionic or B fiber) neuron, the thin but myelinated axon of which emerges with an outgoing spinal or cranial nerve and synapses with one or more of the postsynaptic (postganglionic or, more strictly, ganglionic) neurons composing the autonomic ganglia; the unmyelinated postsynaptic fibers in turn innervate the smooth muscle, cardiac muscle, or gland cells. The presynaptic neurons of the sympathetic part lie in the intermediolateral cell column of the thoracic and upper two lumbar segments of the spinal gray matter; those of the parasympathetic part compose the visceral motor (visceral efferent) nuclei of the brainstem as well as the lateral column of the second to fourth sacral segments of the spinal cord. The ganglia of the sympathetic part are the paravertebral ganglia of the sympathetic trunk and the lumbar and sacral prevertebral or collateral ganglia; those of the parasympathetic part lie either near the organ to be innervated or as intramural ganglia within the organ itself except in the head, where there are four discrete parasympathetic ganglia (ciliary, otic, pterygopalatine, and submandibular). Impulse transmission from presynaptic to postsynaptic neuron is mediated by acetylcholine in both the sympathetic and parasympathetic parts; transmission from the postsynaptic fiber to the visceral effector tissues is classically said to be by acetylcholine in the parasympathetic part and by noradrenalin in the sympathetic part; recent evidence suggests the existence of further noncholinergic, nonadrenergic classes of postsynaptic fibers.
61351|autonomic (visceral motor) nuclei||nuclei located in the spinal cord (T1–L2 and S2–S4) and in the brainstem (Edinger-Westphal nucleus, superior and inferior salivatory nuclei, dorsal vagal nucleus, and parts of the ambiguus nucleus) from which general visceral efferent preganglionic fibers arise; may be sympathetic (T1–L2) or parasympathetic (craniosacral); hypothalamic nuclei/areas function in concert with autonomic nuclei.

New neuroaminidase and hemagglutinin subtypes develop as a result of antigenic drift, and less commonly, antigenic shift resulting in serious human influenza epidemics, and give rise to the need for annual reformulation of flu vaccines to protect against newer active strains. Currently 15 hemagglutinin and 9 neuraminidase subtypes have been identified in reservoir species.

It is a relatively even filamentous process varying in thickness from about 0.25 to more than 10 mcm. In contrast to dendrites, which rarely exceed 1.5 mm in length, axons can extend great distances from the parent cell body (some axons of the pyramidal tract are 40–50 cm long). Axons that are 0.5 mcm thick or more are generally enveloped by a segmented myelin sheath provided by oligodendroglia cells (in the brain and spinal cord) or Schwann cells (in peripheral nerves). Like dendrites and nerve cell bodies, axons contain many neurofibrils. With some exceptions, nerve cells synaptically transmit impulses to other nerve cells or to effector cells (muscle cells or gland cells) exclusively by way of the synaptic terminals of their axons.&#&In neurology and other clinical work, the term axon is also used as meaning dendrites (q.v.), which term is seldom used clinically.

Latency of the response decreases with more proximal stimulation; axon reflex is eliminated by axon degeneration or strong stimuli but not by proximal anesthetic blocks of the nerve.
90299|axon terminals||the somewhat enlarged, often club-shaped endings by which axons make synaptic contacts with other nerve cells or with effector cells (muscle or gland cells).

Motile and nonmotile species occur; motile cells are peritrichous. Body fluids are frequently required for growth. Most species ferment carbohydrates, often with the production of acid; gas may be produced in glucose or peptone media. These organisms occur primarily in the lower intestinal tracts and mucous membranes of warm-blooded animals. They may be pathogenic. The type genus is Bacteroides.

Some species ferment carbohydrates and produce combinations of succinic, lactic, acetic, formic, or propionic acids, sometimes with short-chained alcohols; butyric acid is not a major product. Those species that do not ferment carbohydrates produce from peptone either trace to moderate amounts of succinic, formic, acetic, and lactic acids or major amounts of acetic and butyric acids with moderate amounts of alcohols and isovaleric, propionic, and isobutyric acids. They are part of the normal flora of the intestinal tract and to a lesser degree, the respiratory and urogenital cavities of humans and animals; many species formerly classified as Bacteroides have been reclassified as belonging to the genus Prevotella.

91202|Bayes theorem|bāyz|the impacts of new data on the evidential merits of competing scientific hypotheses are compared by computing for each the product of the antecedent plausibility (the prior probability) and the likelihood of the current data given that hypothesis (the conditional probability) and rescaling them so that their total is unity (the rescaled values being posterior probabilities).
43079|Bayesian hypothesis||an array of surmised values of a parameter to be severally explored in the light of a current set of data, with logical symmetry being preserved among all. The merits of each hypothesis entertained are based on quantity, the prior probability.  The probability of the data conditional on the hypothesis is computed as the conditional probability for each; the product of the two for each hypothesis is the joint probability, and the ratio of each joint probability to the sum of all the joint probabilities is the posterior probability for that hypothesis. Unlike the Neyman-Pearson test of hypotheses, the answer is a statement about the hypothesis, not about the sample conditional on the hypothesis.  No hypothesis is preferred or prevails by default. The procedure may be applied recursively any number of times, as the data becomes available. [Thomas Bayes, British mathematician, 1702–1761]

69767|brachial plexitis||
69794|brachial plexus||major nerve plexus formed of the ventral primary rami of the fifth cervical to first thoracic spinal nerves for innervation of the upper limb. The ventral primary rami entering into formation of the plexus constitute the roots of the plexus; the roots are located in the posterior triangle of the neck, converging to emerge from the scalenus anterior and medius muscles. As they emerge from the scalene hiatus, the C5 and C6 roots combine to form the superior trunk, C7 remains alone as the middle trunk, and the C8 and T1 roots combine to form the inferior trunk of the plexus. The trunks pass beneath the clavicle, passing from the neck into the axilla through the cervicoaxillary canal. As they cross the first rib, all three trunks divide into anterior and posterior divisions of the plexus. Nerve fibers contained within anterior divisions are destined for the anterior aspect of the limb; those contained within the posterior divisions are destined for the posterior aspect of the limb. Within the axilla, the anterior divisions of the superior and middle trunks merge to form the lateral cord of the plexus; the anterior division of the inferior trunk becomes the medial cord of the plexus, and the posterior divisions of all three trunks become the posterior cord, the cords being named for their position in relation to the axillary artery, to which they run parallel and which they surround. The cords of the brachial plexus give rise to most of the named peripheral nerves that are the products of the plexus formation. The major nerves of the lateral cord are the musculocutaneous nerve and the lateral root of the median nerve. The medial cord gives rise to the ulnar nerve and medial root of the median nerve. The lateral and medial roots of the median nerve merge to form the median nerve. The posterior cord of the plexus gives rise to the radial and axillary nerves.

14630|carotene|kar′ō-tēn|A member of a class of carotenoids, yellow-red pigments (lipochromes) widely distributed in plants and animals, notably in carrots, and closely related in structure to the xanthophylls and lycopenes and to the open-chain squalene; of particular interest in that they include precursors of the vitamins A (provitamin A carotenoids). Chemically, they consist of 8 isoprene units in a symmetric chain with the 2 isoprenes at each end cyclized, forming either α-carotene or β-carotene (γ-carotene has only one end cyclized). The cyclic ends of β-carotene are identical β-ioninelike structures; thus, on oxidative fission, β-carotene yields 2 molecules of vitamin A. The cyclic ends of α-carotene differ in that one is an α-ionone and the other a β-ionone; on fission, α-carotene, like γ-carotene, yields 1 molecule of vitamin A (a β-ionone derivative).

All carotenoids may be formally derived from the acyclic C₄₀H₅₆ structure known as lycopene, with its long central chain of conjugated double bonds by hydrogenation, dehydrogenation, oxidation, cyclization, or combinations of these. Included as carotenoids are some compounds arising from certain rearrangements or degradations of the carbon skeleton, but not retinol and related C₂₀ compounds. The nine-carbon end groups may be acyclic with 1,2 and 5,6 double bonds or cyclohexanes with a single double bond at 5,6 or 5,4 or cyclopentanes or aryl groups; these are now designated by Greek letter prefixes preceding “carotene” (α and ΄, which are used in the trivial names α-carotene and ΄-carotene, are not used for that reason). Suffixes (-oic acid, -oate, -al, -one, -ol) indicate certain oxygen-containing groups (acid, ester, aldehyde, ketone, alcohol); all other substitutions appear as prefixes (alkoxy-, epoxy-, hydro-). ). The configuration about all double bonds is trans unless cis and locant numbers appear. The prefix retro- is used to indicate a shift of one position of all single and double bonds; apo- indicates shortening of the molecule. Many carotenoids have anticancer activities.

19384|complement pathways||the classical complement pathway (initiated usually by binding of C1 to IgG or IgM antibody to C1) is a complex of three subunits: C1q, C1r, and C1s. After C1q is bound, C1r (an overbar indicates enzymatic activity) cleaves C1s to C1s. C1s cleaves both C4 into C4a and C4b as well as C2 into C2a and C2b. C2b combines with C4b to form C4b2b, which is a C3 convertase. C3 convertase cleaves C3 into C3a and C3b. C3b joins C4bC2b to form a C5 convertase (also known as C4b2b3b), which cleaves C5 into C5a and C5b. After C5b has been bound to the cell surface, the remainder of the complement components (C6–C9) as well as C5b form the membrane attack complex (MAC). MAC causes a hole in the cell membrane.&#&in the alternative complement pathway, surface-bound C3b binds factor B, which is cleaved by factor D into Ba and Bb. C3bBb is an unstable C3 convertase unless properdin (P) binds to it to form C3bBbP. The stable C3 convertase generates more C3b. When a complex of C3bBbC3b is formed, this is the alternative pathway C5 convertase. From C5b through C9, the classical and alternative pathways are the same.&#&In the lectin-binding pathway, mannose-binding protein initiates the pathway, which then uses components of the classical complement pathway. Some of the “a” components of both pathways have various biologic activities, C3a is an anaphylatoxin.

32859|corticospinal fibers||
92930|corticospinal tract||a composite bundle of corticospinal fibers [TA] that descend into and through the medulla to form the lateral corticospinal tract [TA] and the anterior corticospinal tract [TA]. This massive bundle of fibers originates from pyramidal cells of various sizes in the fifth layer of the precentral motor (area 4), the premotor area (area 6), and to a lesser extent from the somatosensory cortex. Cells of origin in area 4 include the gigantopyramidal cells of Betz. Fibers from these cortical regions descend through the internal capsule, the middle third of the crus cerebri, and the basilar pons to emerge on the anterior surface of the medulla oblongata as the pyramid. Continuing caudally, most of the fibers cross to the opposite side in the pyramidal (motor) decussation and descend in the posterior half of the lateral funiculus of the spinal cord as the lateral corticospinal tract, which distributes its fibers throughout the length of the spinal cord to interneurons of the zona intermedia of the spinal gray matter. In the (extremity-related) spinal cord enlargements, fibers also pass directly to motoneuronal groups that innervate distal extremity muscles subserving particular hand-and-finger or foot-and-toe movements. The uncrossed fibers form a small bundle, the anterior corticospinal tract, which descends in the anterior funiculus of the spinal cord and terminates in synaptic contact with interneurons in the medial half of the anterior horn on both sides of the spinal cord. Interruption of corticospinal fibers rostral to the motor (pyramidal) decussation causes impairment of movement in the opposite body-half, which is especially severe in the arm and leg and is characterized by muscular weakness, spasticity and hyperreflexia, and a loss of discrete finger and hand movements. Lesions of lateral corticospinal fibers caudal to the motor decussation result in comparable deficits on the ipsilateral side of the body. The Babinski sign is associated with this condition of hemiplegia.

25389|Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD)|kroytz′fĕlt yah′kŏb|a progressive neurologic disorder, one of the subacute spongiform encephalopathies caused by prions. Clinical features of CJD include a progressive cerebellar syndrome, including ataxia, abnormalities of gait and speech, and dementia. In most patients, these symptoms are followed by involuntary movements (myoclonus) and the appearance of a typical electroencephalogram pattern (burst suppression, consisting of intermittent sharp and slow wave complexes on a flat background). The average survival time is less than 1 year after onset of symptoms. Changes in the CSF are absent or nonspecific. Mild cortical atrophy and ventricular dilation may be grossly evident. On microscopic examination the distinctive finding is spongiform encephalopathy in gray matter throughout the brain and spinal cord. Severe neuronal loss and gliosis are also present and mild demyelination may occur. Ultrastructural changes include formation of intracytoplasmic vacuoles, which account for the spongy appearance. CJD occurs worldwide at a rate of about 1–2 cases per million population per year. Most cases are sporadic, but 10–12% are inherited. The peak incidence is between 55 and 65 years of age, and the disease is rare before age 30. Cases of iatrogenic CJD have been associated with corneal transplants, electrode implants, dura mater grafts, and administration of human growth hormone. CJD is caused by a prion protein (an abnormal isoform of amyloid protein) that serves as a nucleating factor, inducing abnormalities in other proteins. This protein is detectable by Western blot tesing early in the course of clinical disease. Other prion diseases include Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker (GSS) syndrome, fatal familial insomnia, and kuru in humans; scrapie in sheep and goats; and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE, mad cow disease) in cattle. Similar encephalopathies and wasting syndromes are found in other species. All these diseases have been shown to be transmissible in laboratory animals.

30550|ethanol|eth′ă-nol|A clear, colorless liquid with a faint ethereal odor and a burning taste, which melts at −114.1°C, boils at 78.5°C, and has a density of 0.789 g/mL at 20°C. It is miscible with water and many organic liquids. Ethanol consumed in beer, wine, and distilled liquor is made by fermentation of sugars obtained from natural sources (grain, grapes, potatoes, sugar cane). Both the aroma of an alcoholic beverage and the smell noted on the breath of a person who has consumed it are due in part to the presence of congeners formed during brewing or fermentation and also due to added flavoring agents. Some alcohol used in industry is synthesized from ethylene or acetylene. Fermentation yields a maximum ethanol concentration of about 14%, above which fermentative enzymes are inhibited or destroyed. Higher alcohol concentrations in beverages are obtained either by addition of pure alcohol (fortified wines) or by distillation (whiskey, gin, vodka). The proof number of an alcoholic beverage represents twice the percent by volume of ethanol (120 proof = 60% ethanol by volume). Concentrations up to 95% can be obtained by fractional distillation. Because the combination of 95% ethanol and 5% water is an azeotropic mixture, incapable of being further concentrated by distillation, higher concentrations are obtained with dehydrating agents. In medicine, ethanol is used topically as a rubefacient, coolant, and disinfectant; internally as an analgesic and sedative; and as a solvent or vehicle for other agents. Alcohol USP contains not less than 92.3% nor more than 93.8% ethanol by weight. An alcoholic solution of a nonvolatile substance (benzoin) is called a tincture. If the solute is volatile (menthol), the solution is called a spirit. Ethanol is widely used in industry as a preservative, solvent, and antifreeze and in the manufacture of perfumes, paints, lacquers, and explosives. It also finds employment as an octane booster in automotive fuels. Most industrial ethanol is denatured by the adition of 1–2% of toxic substances to prevent its use as a beverage.
