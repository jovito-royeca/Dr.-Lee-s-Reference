37203|pituitary gland||an unpaired compound gland suspended from the base of the hypothalamus by a short extension of the infundibulum, the infundibular or pituitary stalk. The hypophysis consists of two major divisions. The first, the neurohypophysis, comprises the infundibulum and its bulbous termination, the neural part or infundibular process (posterior lobe), which is composed of neuroglialike pituicytes, blood vessels, and unmyelinated nerve fibers of the hypothalamohypophysial tract. The cell bodies of these axons reside in the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus. These fibers convey to the lobe for storage and release the neurosecretory hormones oxytocin and antidiuretic hormone. The second division, the adenohypophysis, comprises the larger distal part, a sleevelike extension of this lobe (infundibular part) that invests the infundibular stalk, and a thin intermediate part (poorly developed in humans) between the anterior and posterior lobes; the anterior lobe consists of cords of cells of several different types interspersed on the secondary capillary bed of the hypothalamohypophysial portal system. Secretion of somatotropins, prolactin, thyroid-stimulating hormone, gonadotropins, adrenal corticotropin, and other related peptides in the adenohypophysis is regulated by releasing and inhibiting factors elaborated by neurons in the hypothalamus that are taken up by a primary plexus of capillaries in the median eminence and transported through portal vessels in the infundibular part and infundibular stem to a secondary plexus of capillaries in the distal part.

It has a portion of embryonic origin, derived from a highly developed area of the outermost embryonic membrane (chorion frondosum), and a maternal portion formed by a modification of the part of the uterine mucosa (decidua basalis) in which the chorionic vesicle is implanted. Within the placenta, the chorionic villi, with their contained capillaries carrying blood of the embryonic circulation, are exposed to maternal blood in the intervillous spaces in which the villi lie; no direct mixing of fetal and maternal blood occurs, but the intervening tissue (the placental membrane) is sufficiently thin to permit the absorption of nutritive materials, oxygen, and some harmful substances, like viruses, into the fetal blood and the release of carbon dioxide and nitrogenous waste from it. At term, the human placenta is disc shaped, about 4 cm in thickness and 18 cm in diameter, and averages about 1/6–1/7 the weight of the fetus; its fetal surface is smooth, being formed by the adherent amnion, with the umbilical cord normally attached near its center; the maternal surface of a detached placenta is rough because of the torn decidual tissue adhering to the chorion and shows lobular elevations called cotyledons or lobes.

92414|positron emission tomography (PET)||creation of tomographic images revealing certain biochemical properties of tissue by computer analysis of positrons emitted when radioactively tagged substances are incorporated into the tissue. Radiotracers used in PET are analogues of physiologic or pharmaceutical agents into which positron-emitting isotopes with short half-lives (2–110 minutes) have been incorporated. Radioisotopes are produced artificially by bombarding stable isotopes with a proton beam generated by a cyclotron. The uptake and metabolism of these positron emitters mimic, at least in part, those of the radiostable natural substances to which they are analogous. Concentrated in particular organs or tissues and incorporated into metabolic processes, they can reflect biochemical function or dysfunction. The glucose analogue 2-(fluorine-18)fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose (FDG) is widely used to locate zones of heightened energy metabolism. When a positron emitted by a radiotracer collides with an electron, the particles annihilate each other and two gamma rays are discharged in opposite directions (at 180°). After intravenous administration of the radiotracer, the subject is positioned within a scanner consisting of a ring of scintillation crystals that convert gamma rays into flashes of visible light. These flashes are detected and recorded electronically, and a computer program assembles the data into a 3-dimensional image, color-coded to reflect concentration density.

74558|pyruvate (Pyr)|pī′rū-vāt|A salt or ester of pyruvic acid.
74560|pyruvate carboxylase||ligase catalyzing reaction of ATP, pyruvate, and HCO₃²−, to form ADP, orthophosphate, and oxaloacetate; biotin and acetyl-CoA are involved; an absence of this enzyme results in neuronal loss in the cerebral cortex, leading to mental retardation.
74561|pyruvate decarboxylase||a thiamin-pyrophosphate–dependent carboxylase of yeast catalyzing decarboxylation of a 2-oxoacid (pyruvate) to an aldehyde (acetaldehyde) without oxidoreduction and without lipoamide, in contrast to pyruvate dehydrogenase (lipoamide).
74562|pyruvate dehydrogenase||a structurally distinct collection of enzymes containing pyruvate dehydrogenase (lipoamide), dihydrolipoyl transacetylase, and dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase.
74563|pyruvate dehydrogenase (cytochrome)||an oxidoreductase catalyzing reaction between ferricytochrome b₁ and pyruvate to yield acetate and CO₂, and ferrocytochrome b₁.
74564|pyruvate dehydrogenase (lipoamide)||an oxidoreductase catalyzing conversion of pyruvate and (oxidized) lipoamide to CO₂ and S⁶-acetyldihydrolipoamide in two successive reactions: the first between pyruvate and thiamin pyrophosphate to yield CO₂ and α-hydroxyethylthiamin pyrophosphate (active pyruvate); the second between the last named and lipoamide to regain the thiamin pyrophosphate and yield S⁶-acetylhydrolipoamide.
19458|pyruvate dehydrogenase complex||
74565|pyruvate kinase (PK)||a phosphotransferase catalyzing transfer of phosphate from phosphoenolpyruvate to ADP, forming ATP and pyruvate; other nucleoside phosphates can participate in the reaction; a key step in glycolysis; a deficiency in pyruvate kinase will lead to hemolytic anemia.
23221|pyruvate kinase deficiency||a disorder in which there is a deficiency of pyruvate kinase in red blood cells; characterized by hemolytic anemia varying in degree from one patient to another; autosomal recessive inheritance, caused by mutation in the pyruvate kinase liver and red blood cell gene (PKLR) on chromosome 1 q.
74566|pyruvate oxidase||an oxidoreductase catalyzing the reaction of pyruvate, phosphate, and O₂ to yield acetyl phosphate, CO₂, and H₂O₂.
31774|pyruvate oxidation factor||
74567|pyruvic acid|pī-rū′vik as′id|the simplest α-keto acid; an intermediate compound in the metabolism of carbohydrate; in thiamin deficiency, its oxidation is retarded and it accumulates in the tissues, especially in nervous structures. The enol form, enol pyruvic acid, when phosphorylated, plays an important metabolic role.
74568|pyruvic aldehyde|pī-rū′vik al′de-hīd|
74569|pyruvic-malic carboxylase|pī-rū′vik-mal′ik kar-boks′il-ās|
