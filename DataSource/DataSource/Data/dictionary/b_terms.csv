9237|bacteroid|bak′ter-oyd|Resembling bacteria.
9238|Bacteroidaceae|bak′ter-oy-dā′sē-ē|A family of obligate anaerobic (microaerophilic species may occur), non-spore-forming bacteria (order Eubacteriales) containing gram-negative rods that vary in size from minute, filterable forms to long, filamentous, branching forms; pronounced pleomorphism may occur. Motile and nonmotile species occur; motile cells are peritrichous. Body fluids are frequently required for growth. Most species ferment carbohydrates, often with the production of acid; gas may be produced in glucose or peptone media. These organisms occur primarily in the lower intestinal tracts and mucous membranes of warm-blooded animals. They may be pathogenic. The type genus is Bacteroides.
9239|Bacteroides|bak′ter-oy′dēz|A genus that includes many species of obligate anaerobic, non-spore-forming bacteria (family Bacteroidaceae) containing gram-negative rods. Both motile and nonmotile species occur; motile cells are peritrichous. Some species ferment carbohydrates and produce combinations of succinic, lactic, acetic, formic, or propionic acids, sometimes with short-chained alcohols; butyric acid is not a major product. Those species that do not ferment carbohydrates produce from peptone either trace to moderate amounts of succinic, formic, acetic, and lactic acids or major amounts of acetic and butyric acids with moderate amounts of alcohols and isovaleric, propionic, and isobutyric acids. They are part of the normal flora of the intestinal tract and to a lesser degree, the respiratory and urogenital cavities of humans and animals; many species formerly classified as Bacteroides have been reclassified as belonging to the genus Prevotella. Many species can be pathogenic. The type species is Bacteroides fragilis.
9240|Bacteroides bivius||a species usually isolated from urogenital and abdominal infections and linked to pelvic inflammatory disease.
9241|Bacteroides capillosus||a bacterial species isolated from human cysts and wounds, the mouth, and feces, and from the intestinal tracts of some animals. Its properties differ from those of most Bacteroides species; future reclassification is likely.

Although it represents only about 10–20% of Bacteroides species found in the colon, it is the primary species associated with intraabdominal abscesses and other subdiaphragmatic infections in humans, including peritonitis, rectal abscess, abdominal surgical wounds, and urogenital tract infection. Its capsule is capable of inducing abscess formation independently; characteristically, this species produces a β-lactamase that inactivates β-lactam antibiotics such as the penicillin and cephalosporin groups; it is the type species of the genus, Bacteroides.
9246|Bacteroides furcosis||former name for Anaerorhabdus furcosa.
9247|Bacteroides melaninogenicus||

91202|Bayes theorem|bāyz|the impacts of new data on the evidential merits of competing scientific hypotheses are compared by computing for each the product of the antecedent plausibility (the prior probability) and the likelihood of the current data given that hypothesis (the conditional probability) and rescaling them so that their total is unity (the rescaled values being posterior probabilities).
43079|Bayesian hypothesis||an array of surmised values of a parameter to be severally explored in the light of a current set of data, with logical symmetry being preserved among all. The merits of each hypothesis entertained are based on quantity, the prior probability.  The probability of the data conditional on the hypothesis is computed as the conditional probability for each; the product of the two for each hypothesis is the joint probability, and the ratio of each joint probability to the sum of all the joint probabilities is the posterior probability for that hypothesis. Unlike the Neyman-Pearson test of hypotheses, the answer is a statement about the hypothesis, not about the sample conditional on the hypothesis.  No hypothesis is preferred or prevails by default. The procedure may be applied recursively any number of times, as the data becomes available. [Thomas Bayes, British mathematician, 1702–1761]

69767|brachial plexitis||
69794|brachial plexus||major nerve plexus formed of the ventral primary rami of the fifth cervical to first thoracic spinal nerves for innervation of the upper limb. The ventral primary rami entering into formation of the plexus constitute the roots of the plexus; the roots are located in the posterior triangle of the neck, converging to emerge from the scalenus anterior and medius muscles. As they emerge from the scalene hiatus, the C5 and C6 roots combine to form the superior trunk, C7 remains alone as the middle trunk, and the C8 and T1 roots combine to form the inferior trunk of the plexus. The trunks pass beneath the clavicle, passing from the neck into the axilla through the cervicoaxillary canal. As they cross the first rib, all three trunks divide into anterior and posterior divisions of the plexus. Nerve fibers contained within anterior divisions are destined for the anterior aspect of the limb; those contained within the posterior divisions are destined for the posterior aspect of the limb. Within the axilla, the anterior divisions of the superior and middle trunks merge to form the lateral cord of the plexus; the anterior division of the inferior trunk becomes the medial cord of the plexus, and the posterior divisions of all three trunks become the posterior cord, the cords being named for their position in relation to the axillary artery, to which they run parallel and which they surround. The cords of the brachial plexus give rise to most of the named peripheral nerves that are the products of the plexus formation. The major nerves of the lateral cord are the musculocutaneous nerve and the lateral root of the median nerve. The medial cord gives rise to the ulnar nerve and medial root of the median nerve. The lateral and medial roots of the median nerve merge to form the median nerve. The posterior cord of the plexus gives rise to the radial and axillary nerves.

Non-small cell carcinomas are subdivided into adenocarcinomas (50–60%; the most common type in women and nonsmokers), glandular cancers that usually arise peripherally, produce mucin, form tubular or papillary structures, and metastasize widely and early; squamous cell carcinomas (30–40%), which tend to develop centrally and in lower lobes and to metastasize more slowly; and the highly anaplastic large cell carcinomas (10%), which grow rapidly and produce carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA).
