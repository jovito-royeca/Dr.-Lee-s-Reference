43736|immunoglobulin (Ig)|im′yū-nō-glob′yū-lin|One of a class of structurally related proteins, each consisting of two pairs of polypeptide chains, one pair of light (L) low molecular weight chains (κ or λ), and one pair of heavy (H) chains (γ, α, μ, ΄, and ε), usually all four linked by disulfide bonds. On the basis of the structural and antigenic properties of the H chains, immunoglobulins are classified (in order of relative amounts present in normal human serum) as IgG (7S in size, 80%), IgA (10–15%), IgM (19S, a pentamer of the basic unit, 5–10%), IgD (less than 0.1%), and IgE (less than 0.01%). All of these classes are homogeneous and susceptible to amino acid sequence analysis. Each class of H chain can associate with either κ or λ L chains. Subclasses of immunoglobulin, based on differences in the H chains, are referred to as IgG1, etc. When split by papain, IgG yields three pieces: the Fc piece, consisting of the C-terminal portion of the H chains, with no antibody activity but capable of fixing complement, and crystallizable; and two identical Fab pieces, carrying the antigen-binding sites and each consisting of an L chain bound to the remainder of an H chain. Antibodies are immunoglobulins, and all immunoglobulins probably function as antibodies. However, immunoglobulin refers not only to the usual antibodies, but also to a great number of pathologic proteins classified as myeloma proteins, which appear in multiple myeloma along with Bence Jones proteins, myeloma globulins, and immunoglobulin fragments. From the amino acid sequences of Bence Jones proteins, it is known that all L chains are divided into a region of variable sequence (VL) and one of constant sequence (CL), each comprising about half the length of the L chain. The constant regions of all human L chains of the same type (κ or λ) are identical except for a single amino acid substitution, under genetic controls. H chains are similarly divided, although the VH region, although similar in length to the VL region, is only one third or one fourth the length of the CH region. Binding sites are a combination of VL and VH protein regions. The large number of possible combinations of L and H chains make up the “libraries” of antibodies of each individual.
43739|immunoglobulin domains||structural units of immunoglobulin heavy or light chains that are composed of approximately 110 amino acids.

44438|inflammation|in′flă-mā′shŭn|A fundamental pathologic process consisting of a dynamic complex of histologically apparent cytologic changes, cellular infiltration, and mediator release that occurs in the affected blood vessels and adjacent tissues in response to an injury or abnormal stimulation caused by a physical, chemical, or biologic agent, including the local reactions and resulting morphologic changes; the destruction or removal of the injurious material; and the responses that lead to repair and healing. The so-called cardinal signs of inflammation are rubor, redness; calor, heat (or warmth); tumor, swelling; and dolor, pain; a fifth sign, functio laesa, inhibited or lost function, is sometimes added. All these signs may be observed in certain instances, but none is necessarily always present.

44472|influenza|in′flū-en′ză|An acute infectious respiratory disease, caused by Influenza viruses, which are in the family Orthomyxoviridae, in which the inhaled virus attacks the respiratory epithelial cells of those susceptible and produces a catarrhal inflammation; characterized by sudden onset, chills, fever of short duration (3–4 days), severe prostration, headache, muscle aches, and a cough that usually is dry and may be followed by secondary bacterial infections that can last up to 10 days. The disease commonly occurs in epidemics, sometimes in pandemics, which develop quickly and spread rapidly; the mortality rate is usually low, but may rise in patients with secondary bacterial pneumonia, particularly in old people and those with underlying debilitating diseases; strain-specific immunity develops, but mutations in the virus are frequent, and such immunity usually does not affect antigenically different strains.
44473|influenza A||the most common type of influenza. These strains have a high propensity for antigenic change resulting in mutations, partly because they can infect various animals where dual infections can occur, giving rise to new hybrid strains. The infections occur in epidemics, which may occur every 2–3 years and may vary in size and severity; perhaps the most important of the three types of influenza (A, B, and C).
44476|influenza B||influenza caused by strains of influenza virus type B; outbreaks are usually more limited than those due to influenza virus type A, although infections by the two types are clinically indistinguishable; occasionally associated with Reye syndrome.

44485|Influenza virus|in′flū-en′ză vī′rŭs|The family of Orthomyxoviridae contains three genera: Influenzavirus A, B; Influenzavirus C; and “Thogotolike viruses.” Each type of virus has a stable nucleoprotein group antigen common to all strains of the type, but distinct from that of the other type; the genome is negative sense single-stranded RNA in 6–8 segments; each also has a mosaic of surface antigens (hemagglutinin and neuraminidase) that characterize the strains and that are subject to variations of two kinds: 1) a rather continual drift that occurs independently within the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase antigens; 2) after a period of years, a sudden shift (notably in type A virus of human origin) to a different hemagglutinin or neuraminidase antigen. The sudden major shifts are the basis of subdivisions of type A virus of human origin, which occur following infection of the animal host with two different strains simultaneously resulting in a hybrid virus. Strain notations indicate type, geographic origin, year of isolation, and, in the case of type A strains, the characterizing subtypes of hemagglutinin and neuraminidase antigens (A/Hong Kong/1/68 (H₃ N₂); B/Hong Kong/5/72).
96417|influenza virus vaccines||influenza virus grown in embryonated eggs and inactivated, usually by the addition of formalin; both whole virus and subunit preparations containing hemagglutinins and neuraminidase are used; because of the marked and progressive antigenic variation of the influenza viruses, the strains included are regularly changed following various outbreaks of influenza to include most recently isolated epidemic strains of both type A influenza and type B influenza.
98903|influenza viruses||viruses of the family Orthomyxoviridae that cause influenza and influenzalike infections of humans and other animals. These viruses contain single-stranded RNA that is segmented, accounting in part, for their epidemic spread. Viruses included are influenza virus types A and B of the genus Influenzavirus, causing, respectively, influenza A and B, and Influenzavirus C, which belongs to a separate genus and causes influenza C.
44484|influenzal|in′flū-en′zăl|Relating to, marked by, or resulting from influenza.

Multiples (prefixes) in descending order are: exa- (E, 10¹⁸), peta- (P, 10¹⁵), tera- (T, 10¹²), giga- (G, 10⁹), mega- (M, 10⁶), kilo- (k, 10³), hecto- (h, 10²), deca- (da, 10¹), deci- (d, 10−¹), centi- (c, 10−²), milli- (m, 10−³), micro- (μ, 10−⁶), nano- (n, 10−⁹), pico- (p, 10−¹²), femto- (f, 10−¹⁵), atto- (a, 10−¹⁸).

22201|γ-glutamyl cycle||a proposed pathway for the glutathione-dependent transport of certain amino acids (most notably l-cystine, l-methionine, and l-glutamine) and dipeptides into certain cells; this cycle requires the formation of γ-glutamyl amino acids and γ-glutamyl dipeptides as well as a protein for the translocation of these di- and triisopeptides into the cells.

It affects levels of GABA, dopamine, 5-hydroxytryptamine, and acetylcholine, and may itself be a neurotransmitter; accumulation of GHB in people with an inherited disorder in the metabolism of GABA causes ataxia and mental retardation. Synthetic GHB, formerly used in anesthesia and in the treatment of narcolepsy and alcohol withdrawal, has been banned by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration because of severe neurologic, cardiovascular, respiratory, and gastrointestinal side effects.
