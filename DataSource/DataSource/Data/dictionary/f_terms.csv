Factor IX is required for the formation of intrinsic blood thromboplastin and affects the amount formed (rather than the rate). Its active form, factor IXa (EC 3.4.21.22) is a serine proteinase converting factor X to factor Xa by cleaving an arginine-isoleucine bond. Deficiency of factor IX causes hemophilia B.
31752|factor P||a chemical (postulated by T. Lewis), formed in ischemic skeletal or cardiac muscle, held to be responsible for the pain of intermittent claudication and angina pectoris.

People who carry the factor V Leiden gene have a fivefold greater risk of thrombosis than the rest of the population. The factor V mutation (factor V Leiden) is the most common genetic cause of venous thrombosis. The factor V Leiden mutation causes resistance to activated protein C, yielding a defect in the natural anticoagulation system.

Factor VII forms a complex with tissue thromboplastin and calcium to activate factor X. Factor VII is known to be involved in: the congenital deficiency of factor VII, with purpura and bleeding from mucous membranes, autosomal recessive inheritance; the acquired deficiency of factor VII in association with a deficiency of vitamin K, neonatal patients, and the administration of prothrombinopenic drugs; the acquired excess of factor VII in some patients with thromboembolism. It accelerates the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin, in the presence of tissue thromboplastin, calcium, and factor V.
31831|factor VIII||in the clotting of blood, also known as: antihemophilic factor A (Brinkhous), antihemophilic globulin (1) (Patek and Taylor), antihemophilic globulin A (Cramer), plasma thromboplastin factor (Ratnoff), plasma thromboplastin factor A (Aggeler), thromboplastic plasma component (Shinowara), thromboplastinogen (Quick), prothrombokinase (Feissly), platelet cofactor (Johnson), plasmokinin (Laki), thrombokatilysin (Leggenhager), and proserum prothrombin conversion accelerator. Factor VIII participates in the clotting of the blood by forming a complex with factor IXa, platelets, and calcium and by enzymatically catalyzing the activation of factor X. Deficiency of factor VIII is associated with classic hemophilia A. Factor VIIIC is the coagulant component of factor VIII which, in normal people, circulates in the plasma complexed with Factor VIIIR (von Willebrand factor), the plasma factor VIII–related protein, a large glycoprotein component that is synthesized by endothelial cells and megakaryocytes, and circulates in the plasma where it binds to arteries that have lost their endothelial cell linings, creating a surface to which platelets adhere. Disorders involving factor VIIIR comprise a heterogenous group of abnormalities called von Willebrand disease. A deficiency of factor VIII can lead to impaired blood coagulation.
31836|factor X||in the clotting of blood, also known as: Stuart factor, Stuart-Prower factor, prothrombase, and prothrombinase. Its active form, factor Xa (EC 3.4.21.6), is formed from factor X by limited proteolysis and assists in the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin. A deficiency of factor X will lead to impaired blood coagulation.
31837|factor X for Haemophilus||
31838|factor XI||in the clotting of blood, also known as plasma thromboplastin antecedent, a component of the contact system that is absorbed from plasma and serum by glass and similar surfaces. Its active form, factor XIa (EC 3.4.21.27), is a serine proteinase converting factor IX to factor IXa. Deficiency of factor XI results in a hemorrhagic tendency; is caused by an autosomal recessive gene.
31839|factor XII||in the clotting of blood, also known as glass factor and Hageman factor When activated by glass or otherwise to its active form, factor XIIa (EC 3.4.21.38), a serine proteinase, it activates factors VII and XI and converts factor XI to its active form, factor XIa. Deficiency of factor XII results in great prolongation of the clotting time of venous blood, but only rarely in a hemorrhagic tendency; deficiency is caused by an autosomal recessive gene.
31840|factor XIII||in the clotting of blood, also known as: fibrin-stabilizing factor, Laki-Lorand factor, and L-L factor It is catalyzed by thrombin into its active form, factor XIIIa, which cross-links subunits of the fibrin clot to form insoluble fibrin.

98843|feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV)||a slow viral disease of Felidae with worldwide distribution; characterized by chronic immunosuppression and development of secondary opportunist infections and cancers. Primary route of transmission is through bite wounds, but transplacental and nursing transfer are other routes of transmission. In this species, sexual contact is not considered an important transfer route. Species-specific strain; does not cause disease in humans. Other important viruses in the genus include agents of progressive pneumonia in sheep, infectious anemia in horses (EIA), and arthritis-encephalitis in goats. FIV used as a model for human AIDS (HIV) research. Clinical signs variable and often relate to secondary invaders; fever, anorexia, gingivitis, stomatitis, poor haircoat, diarrhea, anemia, lymphopenia (CD4⁺:CD8⁺ ratio used as a prognostic parameter); bladder and respiratory infections are common signs. May cause seizures, abortions, and many cats remain asymptomatic until late stage disease. Licensed vaccine available. Feline leukemia virus, another common slow virus disease of cats is also in the Retroviridae family.
98844|feline leukemia virus (FeLV)||five recognized subtypes; the most common infectious disease in domestic Felidae; another common slow virus disease of cats also in the Retroviridae family is feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV). Symptoms of FeLV may overlap with FIV, depending on potential complicating secondary processes (e.g., secondary bacterial invaders, neoplasia) or physiologic response to chronic slow virus infection (e.g., anemia). Virus shedding occurs in saliva, tears, and excrement. Viruses have poor environmental survival, so close cat contact is needed for agent transfer. Cogrooming and cat bites are common transmission routes. Clinical picture varies from progressive debilitation leading to death, to asymptomatic carriers (bone marrow sequestration). Affected cats may be anemic, icteric, have fading kittens, abortion, infertility, lymphadenopathy, polyuria and polydipsia, diarrhea, lethargy, and death. Vaccine licensed for use.

34884|Fischer projection formulas|fish′ĕr|
86253|Fischer projection formulas of sugars|fish′ĕr|representations, by projection, of cyclic sugars, or derivatives thereof, in which the carbon chain is depicted vertically. The lowest-numbered asymmetric carbon atom (C-1 in aldoses; C-2 in 2-ketoses, fructose) is drawn at the top, and the rest of the carbon atoms of the chain are drawn in sequence below the top carbon atom. For each carbon atom, depicted in projection as lying in the plane of the paper, the carbon-to-carbon bond(s), which actually point away from the viewer, are drawn as vertical lines. The left-hand and right-hand bonds of each carbon atom, which actually point toward the viewer, are, in projection, depicted as horizontal lines. The conventions for the Fischer formulas of cyclic sugars are as follows: 1) If the highest-numbered asymmetric carbon atom has its OH (or its replacement) lying to the right, as is the 2-OH of d-glyceraldehyde, the sugar has the d configuration; if the OH is to the left, the sugar has the l configuration. 2) On the anomeric carbon atom (C-1 in the aldoses; C-2 in the 2-ketoses), an OH or substituted OH that lies to the right, with the OH of the highest-numbered asymmetric carbon atom also to the right, is defined to be α; if it is to the left, with the OH of the highest-numbered carbon atom still to the right, it is β; the reverse applies if the latter OH is to the left. 3) The orientation of a terminal CH₂OH group in the aldoses carries no configurational significance, as the group contains no asymmetric carbon atom.
