14629|carotenase|kar-ot′en-ās|
14630|carotene|kar′ō-tēn|A member of a class of carotenoids, yellow-red pigments (lipochromes) widely distributed in plants and animals, notably in carrots, and closely related in structure to the xanthophylls and lycopenes and to the open-chain squalene; of particular interest in that they include precursors of the vitamins A (provitamin A carotenoids). Chemically, they consist of 8 isoprene units in a symmetric chain with the 2 isoprenes at each end cyclized, forming either α-carotene or β-carotene (γ-carotene has only one end cyclized). The cyclic ends of β-carotene are identical β-ioninelike structures; thus, on oxidative fission, β-carotene yields 2 molecules of vitamin A. The cyclic ends of α-carotene differ in that one is an α-ionone and the other a β-ionone; on fission, α-carotene, like γ-carotene, yields 1 molecule of vitamin A (a β-ionone derivative).

All carotenoids may be formally derived from the acyclic C₄₀H₅₆ structure known as lycopene, with its long central chain of conjugated double bonds by hydrogenation, dehydrogenation, oxidation, cyclization, or combinations of these. Included as carotenoids are some compounds arising from certain rearrangements or degradations of the carbon skeleton, but not retinol and related C₂₀ compounds. The nine-carbon end groups may be acyclic with 1,2 and 5,6 double bonds or cyclohexanes with a single double bond at 5,6 or 5,4 or cyclopentanes or aryl groups; these are now designated by Greek letter prefixes preceding “carotene” (α and ΄, which are used in the trivial names α-carotene and ΄-carotene, are not used for that reason). Suffixes (-oic acid, -oate, -al, -one, -ol) indicate certain oxygen-containing groups (acid, ester, aldehyde, ketone, alcohol); all other substitutions appear as prefixes (alkoxy-, epoxy-, hydro-). ). The configuration about all double bonds is trans unless cis and locant numbers appear. The prefix retro- is used to indicate a shift of one position of all single and double bonds; apo- indicates shortening of the molecule. Many carotenoids have anticancer activities.

19384|complement pathways||the classical complement pathway (initiated usually by binding of C1 to IgG or IgM antibody to C1) is a complex of three subunits: C1q, C1r, and C1s. After C1q is bound, C1r (an overbar indicates enzymatic activity) cleaves C1s to C1s. C1s cleaves both C4 into C4a and C4b as well as C2 into C2a and C2b. C2b combines with C4b to form C4b2b, which is a C3 convertase. C3 convertase cleaves C3 into C3a and C3b. C3b joins C4bC2b to form a C5 convertase (also known as C4b2b3b), which cleaves C5 into C5a and C5b. After C5b has been bound to the cell surface, the remainder of the complement components (C6–C9) as well as C5b form the membrane attack complex (MAC). MAC causes a hole in the cell membrane.&#&in the alternative complement pathway, surface-bound C3b binds factor B, which is cleaved by factor D into Ba and Bb. C3bBb is an unstable C3 convertase unless properdin (P) binds to it to form C3bBbP. The stable C3 convertase generates more C3b. When a complex of C3bBbC3b is formed, this is the alternative pathway C5 convertase. From C5b through C9, the classical and alternative pathways are the same.&#&In the lectin-binding pathway, mannose-binding protein initiates the pathway, which then uses components of the classical complement pathway. Some of the “a” components of both pathways have various biologic activities, C3a is an anaphylatoxin.

92929|corticopontine tract||collective term for the multitude of fibers that, originating in all of the major subdivisions of the cerebral cortex, descend in the internal capsule and crus cerebri to terminate in the nuclei of the basilar part of the pons. Individual components of this massive fiber system are indicated, according to their origin in the cerebral cortex, as the frontopontine fibers [TA], parietopontine fibers [TA], occipitopontine fibers [TA], and temporopontine fibers [TA].

32859|corticospinal fibers||
92930|corticospinal tract||a composite bundle of corticospinal fibers [TA] that descend into and through the medulla to form the lateral corticospinal tract [TA] and the anterior corticospinal tract [TA]. This massive bundle of fibers originates from pyramidal cells of various sizes in the fifth layer of the precentral motor (area 4), the premotor area (area 6), and to a lesser extent from the somatosensory cortex. Cells of origin in area 4 include the gigantopyramidal cells of Betz. Fibers from these cortical regions descend through the internal capsule, the middle third of the crus cerebri, and the basilar pons to emerge on the anterior surface of the medulla oblongata as the pyramid. Continuing caudally, most of the fibers cross to the opposite side in the pyramidal (motor) decussation and descend in the posterior half of the lateral funiculus of the spinal cord as the lateral corticospinal tract, which distributes its fibers throughout the length of the spinal cord to interneurons of the zona intermedia of the spinal gray matter. In the (extremity-related) spinal cord enlargements, fibers also pass directly to motoneuronal groups that innervate distal extremity muscles subserving particular hand-and-finger or foot-and-toe movements. The uncrossed fibers form a small bundle, the anterior corticospinal tract, which descends in the anterior funiculus of the spinal cord and terminates in synaptic contact with interneurons in the medial half of the anterior horn on both sides of the spinal cord. Interruption of corticospinal fibers rostral to the motor (pyramidal) decussation causes impairment of movement in the opposite body-half, which is especially severe in the arm and leg and is characterized by muscular weakness, spasticity and hyperreflexia, and a loss of discrete finger and hand movements. Lesions of lateral corticospinal fibers caudal to the motor decussation result in comparable deficits on the ipsilateral side of the body. The Babinski sign is associated with this condition of hemiplegia.

25389|Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD)|kroytz′fĕlt yah′kŏb|a progressive neurologic disorder, one of the subacute spongiform encephalopathies caused by prions. Clinical features of CJD include a progressive cerebellar syndrome, including ataxia, abnormalities of gait and speech, and dementia. In most patients, these symptoms are followed by involuntary movements (myoclonus) and the appearance of a typical electroencephalogram pattern (burst suppression, consisting of intermittent sharp and slow wave complexes on a flat background). The average survival time is less than 1 year after onset of symptoms. Changes in the CSF are absent or nonspecific. Mild cortical atrophy and ventricular dilation may be grossly evident. On microscopic examination the distinctive finding is spongiform encephalopathy in gray matter throughout the brain and spinal cord. Severe neuronal loss and gliosis are also present and mild demyelination may occur. Ultrastructural changes include formation of intracytoplasmic vacuoles, which account for the spongy appearance. CJD occurs worldwide at a rate of about 1–2 cases per million population per year. Most cases are sporadic, but 10–12% are inherited. The peak incidence is between 55 and 65 years of age, and the disease is rare before age 30. Cases of iatrogenic CJD have been associated with corneal transplants, electrode implants, dura mater grafts, and administration of human growth hormone. CJD is caused by a prion protein (an abnormal isoform of amyloid protein) that serves as a nucleating factor, inducing abnormalities in other proteins. This protein is detectable by Western blot tesing early in the course of clinical disease. Other prion diseases include Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker (GSS) syndrome, fatal familial insomnia, and kuru in humans; scrapie in sheep and goats; and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE, mad cow disease) in cattle. Similar encephalopathies and wasting syndromes are found in other species. All these diseases have been shown to be transmissible in laboratory animals.
