39317|Haworth|hā′wŏrth|Sir Walter Norman, British chemist and Nobel laureate, 1883–1950.
86254|Haworth conformational formulas of cyclic sugars|hā′wŏrth|for the pyranoses, these depict those shapes (conformations) on which no, one, or two ring-atoms lie outside the plane of the ring. If there are two such atoms para to each other, they can lie 1) on opposite sides of the plane (trans), giving chair forms, or 2) on the same side of the plane (cis), giving boat forms. Similarly, there are six boat conformations. If the two (trans) exoplanar atoms are meta to each other, the conformation is a skew form; if the two atoms are ortho to each other, the conformation is a half-chair form. For the furanoses, the envelope conformations have one ring-atom exoplanar. If there are three adjacent, coplanar ring-atoms (the two exoplanar ring-atoms on opposite sides of the plane), the conformations are twist forms.

86255|Haworth perspective formulas of cyclic sugars|hā′wŏrth|perspective representations of furanose or pyranose structures as pentagons or hexagons, respectively, with the connecting bonds so shaded as to make them appear as though the plane of the ring is at a 30° angle to the plane of the paper, and the bonds to H and OH at right angles to the plane of the ring. These formulas depict the planar conformation, a situation not usually met. Other conformational formulas, the Haworth conformational formulas of cyclic sugars, attempt to depict the many deviations from planarity. The basic conventions in Haworth formulas of cyclic sugars (cyclic glycoses) are 1) The lowest-numbered asymmetric ring-carbon atom is depicted at the right. 2) If the highest-numbered asymmetric carbon atom is d, the sugar is d; the formula of an l-glycose may be derived from that of its d-isomer by reversing the up or down direction of all groups attached to the ring-carbon atoms or simply by drawing the mirror image of the entire structure.. 3) If the hydroxyl group attached to the anomeric carbon (C-1 in aldoses, C-2 in 2-ketoses) is below the plane of the ring of a d-glycose, it is α; if above, it is β; the reverse applies if the sugar is l.

40087|hemoglobin (Hb, Hgb)|hē′mō-glō′bin|The red respiratory protein of erythrocytes, consisting of approximately 3.8% heme and 96.2% globin, with a molecular weight of 64,450, which as oxyhemoglobin (HbO₂) transports oxygen from the lungs to the tissues where the oxygen is readily released and HbO₂ becomes Hb. When Hb is exposed to certain chemicals, its normal respiratory function is blocked; the oxygen in HbO₂ is easily displaced by carbon monoxide, thereby resulting in the formation of fairly stable carboxyhemoglobin (HbCO), as in asphyxiation resulting from inhalation of exhaust fumes from gasoline engines. When the iron in Hb is oxidized from the ferrous to ferric state, as in poisoning with nitrates and certain other chemicals, a nonrespiratory compound, methemoglobin (MetHb), is formed. In humans there are at least five kinds of normal Hb: two embryonic Hb's (Hb Gower-1, Hb Gower-2), fetal (Hb F), and two adult types (Hb A, Hb A₂). There are two α globin chains containing 141 amino acid residues, and two of another kind (β, γ, ΄, ε, or ζ), each containing 146 amino acid residues in four of the Hb's. Hb Gower-1 has two ζ chains and two ε chains. The production of each kind of globin chain is controlled by a structural gene of similar Greek letter designation; normal individuals are homozygous for the normal allele at each locus. Substitution of one amino acid for another in the polypeptide chain can occur at any codon in any of the five loci and have resulted in the production of many hundreds of abnormal Hb types, most of no known clinical significance. In addition, deletions of one or more amino acid residues are known, as well as gene rearrangements due to unequal crossing over between homologous chromosomes. The Hb types below are the main abnormal types known to be of clinical significance. Newly discovered abnormal Hb types are first assigned a name, usually the location where discovered, and a molecular formula is added when determined. The formula consists of Greek letters to designate the basic chains, with subscript 2 if there are two identical chains; a superscript letter (A if normal for adult Hb, etc.) is added, or the superscript may designate the site of amino acid substitution (numbering amino acid residues from the N-terminus of the polypeptide) and specifying the change, using standard abbreviations for the amino acids. There is an exhaustive listing of variant Hb's in MIM in which a composite numbering system is used.
40088|hemoglobin A||normal adult Hb (Hb A) with formula α₂Aβ₂A or α₂β₂.
40090|hemoglobin A₁c||the major fraction of glycosylated hemoglobin.

40092|hemoglobin anti-Lepore||a group of abnormal hemoglobins similar to hemoglobin Lepore. These hemoglobins have normal α chains, but the non-α chain consists of the N-terminal portion of the β chain joined to the C-terminal portion of the ΄ chain. This is the opposite crossing over pattern observed in hemoglobin Lepore. Examples of hemoglobin anti-Lepore include HbMiyₐdₐ, Hb PCₒₙgₒ, Hb PNiₗₒₜic, and HbLiₙcₒₗₙ Pₐrₖ. There is also one variant that is both hemoglobin Lepore and hemoglobin anti-Lepore (HbPₐrcₕₘₐₙ).

40098|hemoglobin Chesapeake (HbCₕₑₛₐₚₑₐₖₑ)||an abnormal hemoglobin with a single α-chain substitution, molecular formula α₂⁹²Arg→Leuβ₂A; heterozygotes have polycythemia, apparently to compensate for the increased oxygen affinity of this Hb, resulting in decreased liberation of oxygen in the tissues.
40099|hemoglobin Constant Spring||an abnormal hemoglobin having an extended polypeptide chain (31 additional amino acyl residues) on the α chain (thus, the α chain is 172 amino acids long); approximately 20% of the patients with Hb H disease also have this defect.

40104|hemoglobin F||normal fetal Hb (Hb F) of molecular formula α₂Aγ₂F, which is the major Hb component during intrauterine life, decreasing rapidly during infancy to reach a concentration of less than 0.5% in normal children and adults; the concentration of Hb F is increased in some hemoglobinopathies and in some cases of hypoplastic anemia, pernicious anemia, and leukemia; Hb F has a weaker affinity for 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate than does Hb A. More than 50 mutant variants of the γ chain have been reported.
40106|hemoglobin F (hereditary persistence of)||a condition due to an allele that depresses synthesis of β and ΄ chains (as in thalassemia), but this is fully compensated by increased γ chain synthesis and there is no anemia; there are 3 types: African type, no β or ΄ chain synthesis by the chromosome with the abnormal gene, heterozygotes have 20–30% Hb F and Hb A₂ slightly decreased, homozygotes form no Hb A or Hb A₂; Greek type, reduced β and ΄ chain synthesis, heterozygotes have 10–20% Hb F and normal Hb A₂; Swiss type, heterozygotes have only 1 to 3% Hb F and normal Hb A₂.
40109|hemoglobin Gower-1||a Hb of molecular formula ζ₂ε₂, found as a minor Hb in the early embryo; disappears by the third month of pregnancy in favor of hemoglobin Gower-2 and hemaglobin Portland and then by Hb F; the ζ chain has 141 amino acid residues. Synthesis of the ζ chain is deficient in cases of hydrops fetalis.
40110|hemoglobin Gower-2||a normal Hb of molecular formula α₂Aε₂, which is a major Hb component of the early embryo; production of ε chains normally ceases at about the third month of fetal development and is replaced by Hb F.

Hb H disease (α-thalassemia intermedia) is a thalassemialike syndrome in people heterozygous for both severe and mild genes for α-thalassemia; moderate anemia and red blood cell abnormalities with 25–35% Hb Bart at birth, but with Hb Bart later replaced by Hb H and with Hb A₂ decreased. Hb H shows no cooperativity with O₂ binding and does not exhibit a Bohr effect.
25547|hemoglobin H disease||
40115|hemoglobin I||an abnormal Hb with a single α chain substitution, molecular formula α₂¹⁶Lys→Gluβ₂A; a thalassemialike syndrome has been found in people heterozygous for both Hb I and α-thalassemia genes, with formation of about 70% Hb I.
40116|hemoglobin JCₐₚₑₜₒwₙ||an abnormal Hb with a single α chain substitution, molecular formula α₂⁹²Arg→Glⁿβ₂A; heterozygotes have polycythemia because of increased oxygen affinity of this Hb.
40117|hemoglobin Kansas||an abnormal Hb of molecular formula α₂Aβ₂¹⁰²Asⁿ→Thr; found in association with familial cyanosis due to decreased oxygen affinity of this Hb.
40118|hemoglobin Lepore||a group of abnormal Hb's with normal α chains, but the non-α chains consist of the N-terminal portion of the ΄ chain joined to the C-terminal portion of the β chain, apparently as the result of nonhomologous pairing and crossing over between the genes for β and ΄ chains. The major types are Hb LeporeBₒₛₜₒₙ (identical to Hb LeporeWₐₛₕiₙgₜₒₙ), Hb LeporeHₒₗₗₐₙdiₐ, and Hb LeporeBₐₗₜiₘₒrₑ, which differ in the region of crossing over (΄87–β116, ΄22–β50, and ΄50–β86, respectively). Heterozygotes form about 10% Hb Lepore, normal amounts of Hb A₂, and moderately increased amounts of Hb F and usually have mild anemia, microcytosis, and hypochromia; homozygotes form only Hb Lepore and Hb F and have severe anemia.
40119|hemoglobin M||a group of abnormal Hb's in which a single amino acid substitution favors the formation of methemoglobin in spite of normal quantities of methemoglobin reductase. Strictly speaking, Hb's M are Hb's with mutations at the proximal or distal histidyl residues. Other Hb's M tend to favor the Fe(III) state. Heterozygotes have congenital methemoglobinemia; the homozygous state of these genes is unknown and is presumably lethal. Specific types include: Hb MIwₐₜₑ, α⁸⁷His→Tyr (α chain, position 87, histidine replaced by tyrosine); Hb M Hydₑ Pₐrₖ, β⁹²His→Tyr; Hb MBₒₛₜₒₙ, α⁵⁸His→Tyr; Hb MSₐₛₖₐₜₒₒₙ, β⁶³His→Tyr; Hb MMiₗwₐuₖₑₑ₋₁, β⁶⁷Val→Glu.
