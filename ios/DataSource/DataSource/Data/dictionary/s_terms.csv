Some of the avian schistosome species cause swimmer's itch or cercarial dermatitis in North America and elsewhere. Humans are incidental hosts, so parasites do not mature; causes skin irritation due to allergic reaction to the  parasite.

80000|Schistosoma japonicum||the Oriental or Japanese blood fluke, a species having eggs with small lateral spines, usually only a small knob; causes schistosomiasis japonica, with extensive pathology from encapsulation of the eggs, particularly in the liver, and is the most pathogenic of the three common schistosome species afflicting humans, possibly owing to greater egg production per female worm; it is also the most intractable to treatment and the most difficult to control, as the intermediate hosts are amphibious snails (species of Oncomelania, family Hydrobiidae) that can leave the water to avoid molluscicides, and also because many other animals, such as pigs, oxen, cattle, and dogs, serve as reservoir hosts.
80001|Schistosoma malayensis||a member of the Schistosoma japonicum complex described from the rodent Rattus muelleri in peninsular Malaysia. The aquatic snail Robertsiella kaporensis and two other species of this genus were found to be naturally infected. Schistosoma malayensis is considered most closely related to Schistosoma mekongi. Human infections, based on serologic evidence, were reported among the indigenous people of central peninsular Malaysia.
80002|Schistosoma mansoni||a common species of trematode characterized by large eggs with a strong lateral spine and transmitted by planorbid snails of the genus Biomphalaria; causes schistosomiasis mansoni in humans in Africa, parts of the Middle East, South America, and certain Caribbean islands.

80007|schistosomia|skis′tō-sō′mē-ă|
80008|schistosomiasis|shis′, skis′tō-sō-mī′ă-sis|Infection with a species of Schistosoma; manifestations of this often chronic and debilitating disease vary with the infecting species but depend in large measure on tissue reaction (granulation and fibrosis) to the eggs deposited in venules and in the hepatic portals, the latter resulting in portal hypertension and esophageal varices, as well as liver damage leading to cirrhosis.
80013|schistosomiasis haematobium||infection with Schistosoma haematobium, the eggs of which invade the urinary tract, causing cystitis and hematuria, and possibly an increased likelihood of bladder cancer.

The terminology is regulated by the human genome organization, and each new gene locus, when found, is indicated by “SCA” followed by a number. Currently, at least 23 distinct types have been reported (SCA1–SCA23). All types closely resemble one another clinically and usually cannot be distinguished by phenotype alone. Pathologically, all types are caused by a variable combination of nerve cell loss in the cerebellum, basis pontis, olivary nuclei, substantia nigra anterior horns, and in the posterior thoracic nucleus. Formerly, diseases in this group were usually labeled “Marie ataxia” or “olivopontocerebellar atrophies.” SCA3 is now known as Machado-Joseph disease. Many of these disorders are due to expansions of the CAG sequence in various genes on various chromosomes, including chromosome 3p, 6p, 20p, 5q, 6q, 7q, 8q, 11q, 12q, 15q, 19q, and 22q.

In their contralateral ascent, the bundle is intermingled with numerous intersegmental fibers. These fibers continue from the spinal cord into the brainstem, occupying a ventrolateral position and issuing numerous fibers to the rhombencephalic and mesencephalic reticular formation (spinoreticular fibers), to the accessory olivary nuclei (spinoolivary) fibers, to the lateral part of the central gray substance of the mesencephalon (spinoperiaqueductal fibers), and to the deep and intermediate layers of the superior colliculus (spinotectal fibers); the relatively few fibers (10–20%) that remain are the spinothalamic fibers that enter the diencephalon and end in the nucleus ventralis posterior (caudal part) and intralaminar nuclei of the thalamus. In its ascent in the spinal cord, this tract was originally described as being composed of a dorsal part, the lateral spinothalamic tract, which conveys impulses associated with pain and temperature sensation, and a more ventral part, the anterior spinsothalamic tract, involved in tactile sensation.

85006|steroids|stēr′oydz, ster-|A large family of chemical substances, comprising many hormones, body constituents, and drugs, each containing the tetracyclic cyclopenta[a]phenanthrene skeleton. Stereoisomerism among steroids is not only common but of critical biologic significance. The nomenclature conventions are that the nucleus is presented as if projected onto the plane of the paper, with groups then lying above that plane being denoted by thickened bonds and called β and those then lying below that plane being denoted by broken bonds and called α; the letter ξ indicates unknown or unspecified orientation. The principal classes of steroids, with the names for the unsubstituted, saturated hydrocarbon forms that are clearly related to physiologic functions or sources are: 1) gonanes (in which the methyl groups C-18 and C-19, have been replaced by H), 2) estranes (in which the C-19 methyl groups have been replaced by H), 3) androstanes (equivalent to Formula II), 4) norandrostanes (in which one of the methyl groups, typically C-18, has been replaced by H), 5) cholanes (with —CH(CH₃)(CH₂)₂CH₃ bonded to C-17), 6) cholestanes (with —CH(CH₃)(CH₂)₃CH(CH₃)₂ at C-17, 7) ergostanes (with —CH(CH₃)(CH₂)₂CH(CH₃)CH(CH₃)₂ at C-17), and 8) stigmastanes (with —CH(CH₃)(CH₂)₂CH(CH₂CHCH₃)CH(CH₃)₂ at C-17). In addition, each of the classes can be in a 5α or 5β series. The steroid derivatives known as cardanolides are androstanes with a 5-membered lactone linked to C-1&#&The squill-toad poisons known as the bufanolides are androstanes with a 6-membered lactone linked to C-1&#&Spirostans and furostans (the basic structures of many “genins,” including the sapogenins) are androstanes having certain cyclic ether moieties. The natural and synthetic derivatives are named by adding conventional chemical prefixes and suffixes for substituents; -ol for a hydroxyl group, -on(e) for a keto group, -al for an aldehyde group. “Nor” indicates loss of a –CH₂— group; “homo,” the addition of a –CH₂— group; each is preceded by the letter indicating which ring is contracted or expanded, respectively, or, in the case where the –CH₂— is lost from a methyl group, the number of the carbon atom lost. “Seco” indicates fission of a ring with the addition of hydrogen atoms at the positions indicated by numerals preceding the term. Unsaturation is denoted, as usual, by substituting appropriate terms, -en(e), -yn(e), -adien(e), for the -ane or -an parts of the hydrocarbon or parent class names, with numerals indicating locations of the unsaturated bonds. The locations of double bonds are specified by the lower of the two (consecutive) numbers of the carbon atoms involved. When a double bond is formed between two nonconsecutive carbon atoms, the second is indicated in parentheses after the first; estriol and the estradiols possess three double bonds, between C-1 and C-2, between C-3 and C-4, and between C-5 and C-10, respectively. Steroid alkaloids may be named from the steroid parent, as above, or from trivial family names usually ending in -anine if the steroid is saturated or in -enine, -adienine, etc., if it is not saturated (conanine, tomatanine).

87479|synapse|sin′aps, sĭ-naps′; sy-nap′sez|The functional membrane-to-membrane contact of the nerve cell with another nerve cell, an effector (muscle or gland) cell, or a sensory receptor cell. The synapse subserves the transmission of nerve impulses, commonly from a variably large (1–12 mcm), generally knob-shaped or club-shaped axon terminal (the presynaptic element) to the circumscript patch of the receiving cell's plasma membrane (the postsynaptic element) on which the synapse occurs. In most cases, the impulse is transmitted by means of a chemical transmitter substance (such as acetylcholine, γ-aminobutyric acid, dopamine, or norepinephrine) released into a synaptic cleft (15–50 nm wide) that separates the presynaptic from the postsynaptic membrane; the transmitter is stored in quantal form in round or ellipsoid, membrane-bound synaptic vesicles (10–50 nm in diameter) in the presynaptic element. In other synapses, transmission takes place by direct propagation of the bioelectrical potential from the presynaptic to the postsynaptic membrane; in such electrotonic synapses (“gap junctions”), the synaptic cleft is no more than about 2 nm wide. In most cases, synaptic transmission takes place in only one direction (“dynamic polarity” of the synapse), but in some synapses synaptic vesicles occur on both sides of the synaptic cleft, which suggest the possibility of reciprocal chemical transmission.
