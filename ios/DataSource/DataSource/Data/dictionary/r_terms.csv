The symptoms are characteristic of a profound disturbance of the nervous system, excitement, aggressiveness, and madness, followed by paralysis and death. In animals, clinical signs are variable, and sometimes drooling and tongue paralysis are the only signs. Transmission of the virus can occur before clinical signs are expressed.

It was replaced, in the case of humans, by rabies vaccine of duck embryo origin (DEV), prepared from embryonated duck eggs infected with “fixed” virus and inactivated with β-propiolactone. At the present time DEV has been replaced by either human diploid cell vaccine (HDCV), which is grown in WI-38 cells or rabies vaccine adsorbed (RVA), which is grown in fetal Rhesus monkey cells.

Although the random process is widely used in probability theory, empiric justification for the term is more complicated.  The minimum requirement is that repeated realization of the process will settle down to a stable distribution or, if not metric, a stable set of frequencies if the trait is classifiable only.

79564|random sampling||a selection of elements from a population such that each possible outcome is independent of other possible outcomes and the probability of each member of the population being chosen is equal.
96843|random variable||a variable that may assume a set of values, each with fixed probabilities or probability densities (its distribution), in such a way that the total probability assigned to the distribution is unity; the random variable may be discrete, continuous, or mixed discrete-continuous.

75765|randomization|ran′dom-ĭ-zā′shun|Random allocation, the process of selecting entities, treatment regimens,  using a formal system whereby each entity has a known, generally an equal chance of being selected.

By placing the tines of a vibrating tuning fork near the pinna, the acoustic stimulus is presented by air conduction, and by placing the stem of a vibrating tuning fork on the mastoid process, the acoustic stimulus is presented by bone conduction. In conductive hearing losses, the stimulus is heard louder and longer by bone conduction. In sensorineural hearing losses, the stimulus is heard louder and longer by air conduction. The result of the test is reported for each ear as air conduction is found to be greater than bone conduction, or vice versa. This information is combined with the result of the Weber tuning fork test in interpretating the type of hearing loss.
